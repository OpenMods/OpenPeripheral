Functions in the HTTP API:
http.request( url, postData* )
http.get( url )
http.post( url, postData )
*optional

The HTTP API must be enabled in ComputerCraft.cfg before being used.
A period of time after a http.request() call is made, a "http_success" or "http_failure" event will be raised. Arguments are the url and a file handle if successful. http.get() and http.post() block until this event fires.
